## Spell Check

Document editor performs spell check by processing hunspell dictionary files, So kindly follow below steps to include the necessary files to perform spell check.

### Where to find the dictionaries?
[Hunspell Dictionaries](https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries) - Dictionary location

### Steps to configure spell checker

* In the application App_Data folder, include the dictionary, .aff dictionary files and JSON file.

JSON file should contains the values in the following format.

```json
[
  {
    "LanguadeID": 1036, 
    "DictionaryPath": "fr_FR.dic",
    "AffixPath": "fr_FR.aff", 
    "PersonalDictPath": "customDict.dic"
  },
  {
    "LanguadeID": 1033,
    "DictionaryPath": "en_US.dic",
    "AffixPath": "en_US.aff",
    "PersonalDictPath": "customDict.dic"
  }
]
```

* For handling personal dictionary, place empty .dic file (ex. customDict.dic file) in the App_Data folder.

* Refer the added files in the spell checker service call as well where we will pass the file information

### How it works

* Spell checking will be performed based on the below information from client side and it will be passed to **GetSuggestions** API to process spell checker.

### LanguageID

Spell checking will be initiated only when languageID value passed in client side present in the **DictionaryData** collection.
